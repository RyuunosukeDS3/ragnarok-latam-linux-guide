    If you don't have Flatpak installed yet:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install flatpak
    ```

    Add the Flathub repository:

    ```bash
    flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

    The Flatpak version of Heroic Games Launcher is preferable as it ensures quicker updates, better permission control, and superior performance compared to APT or Snap, which may ship outdated versions or carry extra overhead. Also, being the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù way, it's the one recommended by the developers themselves.

### üîß Workarounds

On the Nidhogg server, there's an issue where the city **Prontera** becomes inaccessible ‚Äî you may get the `Disconnected from Server` error when trying to load a character located there. To fix this (and possibly other similar map/server issues), run the following command while the game is running:

```bash
   sudo sysctl -w /etc/sysctl.conf
```

If you prefer, you can make this change permanent by editing the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file and adding the line `/etc/sysctl.conf` at the end.

  <b>‚ö†Ô∏è Heads-up:</b>  
  This is still a topic of active discussion in the community, so the best thing for now is to check the Discord server if you have any questions about this step!

This workaround was discovered by **@trololobr** on Discord!

## üöÄ Running Ragnarok

Now you can launch the game normally from Heroic.  
If everything is set up correctly, Ragnarok will open and run without issues!
